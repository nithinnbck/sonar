This Repository consists of different **COMMAND LINE APPLICATIONS** that I developed using Python 3.

-	### Dice Game: 
    > - Command Line Simulation of a Two player Dice Game (6 sided). 
    > - There are two modes of playing in this game: 
        - Computer vs Player - Where a player can play with the Computer.
        - Player vs Player - A player plays with another player.

-	### Flipkart Mobile Price Finder: 
    > - Given a bunch of links of different Mobile Phones on Flipkart, this script will find the price of those items and print it on the command line. 
    > - This is used to keep a track of an item's price that a user would like to buy so that he can make a purchase when there is a price drop.

-	### Online Coding Platforms Rating Tracker: 
    > - Given the URLs of users profile in Codeforces, Codechef, Hacker Earth, SPOJ and Interview Bit, this script will print their ratings and ranks. 
    > - By running this script, a user can check his all ratings without explicitly navigating to the respective URLs.
